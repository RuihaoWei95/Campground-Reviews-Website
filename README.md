# Technologies:
**MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture to achieve separation of concerns and maintain independence about backend/frontend services. \
**Express.js** minimal, unopinionated backend framework to keep serverside boilerplate as low as possible. Especially useful for learning how to piece different technologies together to develop a complete backend. Express-Session to learn how cookies work to deliver a rich user experience through client and serverside cookies. \
**Passport.js** for authentication and authorization. \
**MongoDB** as the primary NoSQL database to store campgrounds, users, reviews, and session details. Mongoose as an ORM(Object relation mapping) library to interact with MongoDB. \
**Cloudinary** to store images of campgrounds when users create new campgrounds, and to optimize them for when the client side requests them. \
**Mapbox** to deliver an interactive map for users to visually see the location of campgrounds through a cluster map and a zoomed-in map for each campground.
**EJS** (Embedded JavaScript Templates) as a templating language to create dynamic user experiences. 
Bootstrap is the driving CSS framework to create visually appealing user experiences.
